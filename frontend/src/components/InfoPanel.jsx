      <h2>üîç Network Traffic Analysis & Packet Sniffing</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Network Traffic Analysis</strong> is the process of capturing and inspecting data packets moving through a network. It helps monitor performance, detect intrusions, and understand how data flows.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Packet Sniffing</strong> involves collecting low-level data packets to analyze protocols, IPs, ports, and payloads. It's essential for diagnosing issues, detecting anomalies, and enhancing cybersecurity.
